== Description ==

Black Jack Strategy Guide will give a quick answer what to do in every situation when playing black jack. It will display the correct play based on the cards that the user has selected. The calculator can be displayed in your sidebar where the users can use it and see the correct play in every situation. It will give the user a quick response what to do in every situation when playing black jack. 

Blackjack is game between a player and a dealer where the goal is to reach the final score of 21 AKA blackjack. It is played widely in the whole world. If you're new to blackjack, this plugin will make your life a lot easier. The plugin is mobile friendly so you or your websites visitor could even use it while being involved in a live game of blackjack and benefit greatly from the plugin. 

= Black Jack rules that the plugin follows =
Assumption is, that black jack is played with the following rules:
* Black Jack is played from 4 to 8 decks.
* Dealer stands on soft 17

Playing blackjack with a different set of rules will also mean that there is difference in the correct play as well. Not a lot, but in few situations you might act differently. The rules that we chose to follow are the most common ones in blackjack, in the future we hope to add other variations as well. 

We have provided some flexibility in the plugin as in some cases the Black Jack Strategy Guide plugin will give you two options to choose from. For example if you're playing blackjack with rules that allow you to surrender we will display the spots where surrender is the correct play and also provide the alternative option if surrendering your hand is not allowed.  

= Correct Play = 
The correct play is based on the Black Jack card from Wizard of Odds. Their information is realiable and therefore very largely used to look for information when playing blackjack. Still remember, that the correct play does not equal to winning play in blackjack as the house will still have an edge on you. Playing blackjack accordingly will optimize the results thought.

= Fast to use =
After the initial load of the plugin it doesn't have to load anything anymore and therefore the plugin is very fast to use. It gives you the correct play in blackjack at a very rapid speed. One click and there it is!

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Is the correct play accurate? =

Yes, the correct play is based on the black jack guide card which provides the optimal play. 

= What if the amount of decks varies from 4 to 8 decks? =

If you're playing black jack with different rules, the results aren't accurate. This plugin is based on the assumption that the number of decks in black jack is from 4 to 8. However we might release different versions on the next update as we are aware that sometimes blackjack is played under different rules.

= How fast does the plugin give the correct play? =

The Black Jack Strategy Guide displays the correct play in less than a second. So you can use while playing blackjack as it is that fast!

= In the plugin the term soft is mentioned, what does it mean? =

Soft means that the players hand has an ace along with another card. Ace is 1 and 11 in black jack so if you would have for example Ace and a five you would have 6 / 16 = soft 16. 

= Does it provide information in every possible situation? =

Yes, the Black Jack Strategy Guide will provide accurate information no matter what hands are dealt to the table.  

= Do I win every time when playing black jack if I use the correct play? =

Unfortunately the answer to this is no. The house will always have an edge on you. However using the correct play in every situation will provide you the best possible chance.
